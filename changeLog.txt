	- AnnotSV is now available for the Mouse genome SV annotations
	- Add the UTR/CDS's information from overlapping genes (location2 column)
	- Add bugfix concerning the use of the "-candidateGenesFile" and "-reciprocal" options

	- Add bugfix concerning the report of gene-based annotation on the full lines

Apr 18, 2019: AnnotSV version 2.1
	- Include the gnomAD SV frequency annotation
	- Include the Ira M. Hall’s lab SV frequency annotations
	- Include GeneHancer annotation (an integrated compendium of human promoters, enhancers and their inferred target genes)
	  WARNING: not supplied as part of the AnnotSV sources. Users need to request the up-to-date GeneHancer data dedicated to AnnotSV
	- Include 2 new options: "-overwrite" to overwrite existing output results (default = yes)
	                         "-txFile" to specify a list of preferred genes transcripts to be used in priority during the annotation
	- Default of the -SVinputInfo option is now set to 1 (the additional fields from the SV input file are reported in the outputfile) 
	- Large bed annotation files are presorted, in order to be compatible for server with low specifications
	- Improve error messages and exit management (return a non-zero exit code in case of error or zero if all went fine)
	- AnnotSV minimum requirement is now starting with Tcl 8.5
	- Add bugfix concerning the homozygous and heterozygous SNV/indel counts within the SV to annotate
	- Add bugfix for the SV ranking (when the -metrics option was set to "fr")
	- Add bugfix concerning the "-reciprocal" option

Dec 21, 2018: AnnotSV version 2.0
	- Add ranking/classification for SV in 5 classes (from benign to pathogenic)
	- Include 12 additional annotations including:
		-> the creation of a unique identifier for each SV
		-> the SV length
		-> the SV type (DEL, DUP, ...)
		-> the SV ranking/classification
		-> the OMIM morbid genes
		-> the ClinGen Haploinsufficiency Score
		-> the ClinGen Triplosensitivity Score
		-> the ACMG genes
		-> the CNV intolerance from ExAC
	- Add of the "metrics" option to change numerical values to us or fr metrics (e.g. 0.2 or 0,2)
	- Add bugfix concerning empty SV input file: return a non-zero exit status (1) to continue processing in a pipeline
	- Modification of the directories structure for the annotation. Please look at the README file.
	- Options: "SVfromDBoverlap", "FeaturesOverlap" and "SVtoAnnOverlap" have been replaced by "reciprocal" and "overlap"
	- By default, AnnotSV now reports the additional fields from the SV BED input file
	- Report of the input BED file header in the output
	- Update of all annotation sources provided with AnnotSV

Sep 28, 2018: AnnotSV version 1.2
	- Support the integration of user defined annotated regions imported from BED and/or TSV file(s) into the output file
	- Include 3 additional annotations based on the dbVar pathogenic NR SV dataset:
		-> The dbVar NR SV event types (e.g. deletion, duplication…)
		-> The dbVar NR SV accession (e.g. nssv1415016)
		-> The dbVar NR SV clinical assertion (e.g. pathogenic, likely pathogenic)
	- Include 1 new option (-typeOfAnnotation) to configure the types of lines produced by AnnotSV (both, full or split)
	- OutputFile extension will always be a “.tsv” (tab separated values) extension
	- Add bugfix concerning large SV and TAD boundaries annotation

May 16, 2018: AnnotSV version 1.1.1
	- Add bugfix concerning 1000g annotation (in some cases, an insertion could be not reported and AnnotSV stopped working properly)

Mar 20, 2018: AnnotSV version 1.1
	- Add bugfix concerning counts of the homozygous and heterozygous variants in VCF files
	- Support for new SV input file format: VCF file (4.3) can now be used to describe the SV to annotate (in addition to the BED format)
	  The "-bedFile" option has now been renamed "-SVinputFile"
	  The "-bedInfo" option has now been renamed "-SVinputInfo". Default is now set to 0 (the additional fields from the SV input file are not reported in the outputfile)
	- Report additional information while counting variants in the SNV/indel input file(s):
		-> The number of SNV/indel loaded
		-> The number of SNV/indel not considered because of the “FILTER” column value
		-> The number of SNV/indel not considered because of the absence of genotype information (“GT” value can be absent in bad VCF formatted files)
		-> The number of SV present but not considered for that purpose (only SNV/indel are taken into account)
	- Set the default value of the -vcfPASS option to 0 (to be non-restrictive and consider all variants in the VCF by default).
	- Include 2 new options (-outputDir and -outputFile) to specify the output directory and file name
	- Include 3 additional annotations based on the 1000 genomes phase 3 dataset:
		-> The type of event (i.e. DEL, ALU, DUP, <CN3>...)
		-> The global allele frequency
		-> The maximum observed allele frequency across populations
	- Include a new option (-SVminSize) to set the SV minimum size (in bp). Default is 50 (bp)


Dec 21, 2017: AnnotSV version 1.0
